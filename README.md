# personal_finance
Personal finance dashboard for my own use
* very sketchy back end that basically just interfaces with a .csv file
* front end -- made with vite, react, and bootstrap.

# TODOS:
* bug fixing
* some form of versioning or write safety (kind of a big point of this project)
* big expenses in this table as a pagination thing
* login
